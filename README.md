# TWIR @ Reddit

This project is used to find [r/rust](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust) comment threads of articles featured in [This Week in Rust (TWIR)](https://this-week-in-rust.org).
I've always found it helpful to search for additional insights in the comment section of Reddit Threads


To generate the output for the latest week run
```bash
just run
```

This will check the latest TWIR and search for reddit posts 2 weeks back.
